# Breast Cancer Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks
Graduation Project group from Suez University - Faculty of Computers and Information
## introduction
Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide. Breast Cancer is the most prevalent cancer among Egyptian women and constitutes 29% of National Cancer Institute cases. Median age at diagnosis is one decade younger than in countries of Europe and North America.

## Hands on Practice
we started this project with zero experience in data science, and to reach our goal we had to go through some steps./
we had to learn about image processing, Ai, machine learning, neural networks and deep learning and what underlies them of technologies and tools like python, matlab, pytorch, keras and tensorflow./
after being familiar with the concepts of machine learning and deep learning we started using these tools and technology to create models and to train them on different datasets in order to increase our level of understanding the concepts of neural networks./
