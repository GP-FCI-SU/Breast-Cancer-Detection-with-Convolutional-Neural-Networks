# Breast Cancer Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks
Graduation Project group from Suez University - Faculty of Computers and Information
## introduction
Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among women and the second most common cancer overall, impacting 2.1 million women each year, and also causes the greatest number of cancer-related deaths among women. In 2018, it is estimated that 627,000 women died from breast cancer â€“ that is approximately 15% of all cancer deaths among women. While breast cancer rates are higher among women in more developed regions, rates are increasing in nearly every region globally. Breast Cancer is the most prevalent cancer among Egyptian women and constitutes 29% of National Cancer Institute cases. Median age at diagnosis is one decade younger than in countries of Europe and North America.  

Our goal is to build a convolutional neural networks that works on mammography images of breast cancer to make a binary classification  normal or abnormal.  
we are doing this to enhance the efforts done by our community leaders fighting the cancer and especially breast cancer like Baheya Hospital and Egyptian National Cancer Institute.

## Hands on Practice
we started this project with zero experience in data science, and to reach our goal we had to go through some steps.  
we had to learn about image processing, Ai, machine learning, neural networks and deep learning and what underlies them of technologies and tools like python, matlab, pytorch, keras and tensorflow.  
after being familiar with the concepts of machine learning and deep learning we started using these tools and technologies to create models and to train them on different datasets in order to increase our level of understanding of the concepts of neural networks.
